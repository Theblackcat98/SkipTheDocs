#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian systems.
#
# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options most of which
# are not shown in this example
#
# Some options that are often worth tuning have been included as
# commented-out examples in this file.
#  - When such options are commented with ";", the proposed setting
#    differs from the default Samba behaviour
#  - When commented with "#", the proposed setting is the default
#    behaviour of Samba but the option is considered important
#    enough to be mentioned here.
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command
# "testparm" to check both the syntax and the consistency of the
# configuration.

#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

# Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section:
# WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable its WINS Server
#   wins support = no

# WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
# Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but NOT both
#   wins server = w.x.y.z

# This will prevent nmbd to search for WINS servers despite the presence of
# wins server = lines in this file.
#   dns proxy = no

#### Networking ####

# The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
# This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
# interface names are normally preferred
#   interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0

# Only bind to the named interfaces and reject connections from other interfaces
#   bind interfaces only = yes

#### Debugging/Accounting ####

# This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
# that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

# Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = 1000

# We want Samba to only log to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd}
# We don't want it to log to syslog also.
   logging = file

# Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

####### Authentication #######

# Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate.
# "user" is the default.
#   server role = standalone server

# If you are setting up a DC, you must set this to "yes".
#   map to guest = bad user

########## Domains ###########

#
# The following settings are appropriate for Samba running as a domain
# member server.
#
#   security = ads
#   realm = YOUR-REALM.COM
#   password server = your-ad-dc.your-realm.com
#   encrypt passwords = yes
#
#   idmap config * : backend = tdb
#   idmap config * : range = 3000-7999
#   idmap config YOUR-REALM.COM : backend = rid
#   idmap config YOUR-REALM.COM : range = 10000-999999
#
#   winbind use default domain = yes
#   winbind offline logon = false
#   winbind enum users = yes
#   winbind enum groups = yes
#   winbind refresh tickets = yes
#
#   template shell = /bin/bash
#   template homedir = /home/%D/%U

#
# The following settings are appropriate for Samba running as a DC.
#
#   server role = active directory domain controller
#   workgroup = SAMDOM
#   realm = samdom.example.com
#   netbios name = DC1
#   passdb backend = samba_dsdb
#   dns forwarder = 8.8.8.8

#======================= Share Definitions =======================

[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no

# By default, the home directories are exported read-only. Change next
# parameter to 'yes' if you want to be able to write to them.
   read only = yes

# File creation mask is set to 0700 for security reasons. If you want to
# create files with group=rw permissions, set next parameter to 0775.
   create mask = 0700

# Directory creation mask is set to 0700 for security reasons. If you want to
# create dirs. with group=rw permissions, set next parameter to 0775.
   directory mask = 0700

# By default, \server\username shares can be connected to by anyone
# with access to the samba server.
# The following parameter makes sure that only "username" can connect
# to \server\username
# This might need tweaking when using external authentication schemes
   valid users = %S

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

# Windows clients look for this share name as a source of downloadable
# printer drivers
[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
