# This is a dummy config file for rsync. Rsync is usually configured with command-line options.
# However, you can create a daemon with a configuration file.
# This is a sample rsyncd.conf file.
#
# pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid
# lock file = /var/run/rsync.lock
# log file = /var/log/rsync.log
#
# [files]
#     path = /srv/files
#     comment = My files
#     read only = true
#     list = yes
#     uid = nobody
#     gid = nobody
#     auth users = user
#     secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets
