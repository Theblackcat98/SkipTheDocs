# This is a dummy config file for FFmpeg. FFmpeg is a command-line tool and is usually configured with options.
# You can use presets to store a set of options.
# For example, you can create a file named 'my_preset.ffpreset' in ~/.ffmpeg/ with content like:
# vcodec=libx264
# acodec=aac
# And then use it with:
# ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -preset my_preset output.mp4
